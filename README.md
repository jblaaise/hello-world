# hello-world

Hi! I'm Jackie Blaise

I am a SMAD and Marketing double major at James Madison University. I love to travel, cook, and watch shows or movies with my closest friend in my free time. 

I have 3 siblings and reside in Clifton, VA. During the school year, I live off-campus in Harrisonburg.
